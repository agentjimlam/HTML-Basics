<!-- Can some one explain what does “[0-9]{14,16}” and [a-zA-Z0-9]+ mean?
Ans: 

[0-9]{14,16}

The square brackets denote a class which is akin to a set of all digits 0 thru 9 inclusive. The curly braces denote a character count, above that would be minimum 14, maximum 16.

[a-zA-Z0-9]+

Again, this is a class that contains all the lowercase letters a thru z, all the uppercase letters A thru Z and all the digits 0 thru 9. The plus sign means one or more times.

<!-- Can some one explain what does “[0-9]{14,16}” and [a-zA-Z0-9]+ mean?
Ans: 

[0-9]{14,16}

The square brackets denote a class which is akin to a set of all digits 0 thru 9 inclusive. The curly braces denote a character count, above that would be minimum 14, maximum 16.

[a-zA-Z0-9]+

Again, this is a class that contains all the lowercase letters a thru z, all the uppercase letters A thru Z and all the digits 0 thru 9. The plus sign means one or more times.

<p>
In addition to checking the length of a text, we could also add a validation to check how the text was provided. For cases when we want user input to follow specific guidelines, we use the pattern attribute and assign it a regular expression, or regex. Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that make up a search pattern. If the input matches the regex, the form can be submitted.

Let’s say we wanted to check for a valid credit card number (a 14 to 16 digit number). We could use the regex: [0-9]{14,16} which checks that the user provided only numbers and that they entered at least 14 digits and at most 16 digits.

To add this to a form:

<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="payment">Credit Card Number (no spaces):</label>
  <br>
  <input id="payment" name="payment" type="text" required pattern="[0-9]{14,16}">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
</p>

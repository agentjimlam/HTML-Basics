What is section element? Why not just use div element
Ans: In a nutshell, semantic HTML is a graphic design method without the use of graphic. 

The <div> element is the most general purpose element. It has no special meaning. 
- <div> is for just solely styling purpose. 

It’s purpose is to group content that is not semantically related. Because it is essentially meaningless to screen readers, it should be sparingly used.

Section is for more meaningful for like this "Newsletter" section of page. 

Because the contents of a <section> are meaningful when grouped together, they should have a “theme”. A <section>’s “theme” should be defined by including a heading element within the element, 
often immediately after the opening tag.

<section class="newsletter">
  <h1>Subscribe to the Newsletter</h1>
  <form> <!-- ... --> </form>
</section>

<!-- How can I create a default value that disappears when the user types in the form?
Ans: the placeholder attribute

A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control . The placeholder text must not contain carriage returns or line-feeds. This attribute applies when the value of the type attribute is text , search , tel , url or email ; otherwise it is ignored.

For example, this is the search input field from Rotten Tomatoes:
<input type="text" name="search" class="form-control" placeholder="Search movies, TV, actors, more..." id="fullscreen-search-term" autocomplete="off" value="">


<!-- What is difference between name attribute and <id>?
Ans: <id> is a higher power, it is to give unique identifier to certain elements. There can only be one element by a given id in a web page, 
but there can be multiple forms with their own Submit, and their name atrributes can be the same. 

Yes, in terms of POST DATA, the name attribute is the unique identifier of the submitted value. id is the unique identifier of the DOM element. An id selector has higher specificity, more so than a name attribute selector. 
There can only be one element by a given id in a web page, but there can be multiple forms with their own Submit, and their name attributes could be the same.

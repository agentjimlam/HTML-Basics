What is section element? Why not just use div element
Ans: In a nutshell, semantic HTML is a graphic design method without the use of graphic. 

The <div> element is the most general purpose element. It has no special meaning. 
- <div> is for just solely styling purpose. 

It’s purpose is to group content that is not semantically related. Because it is essentially meaningless to screen readers, it should be sparingly used.

Section is for more meaningful for like this "Newsletter" section of page. 

Because the contents of a <section> are meaningful when grouped together, they should have a “theme”. A <section>’s “theme” should be defined by including a heading element within the element, 
often immediately after the opening tag.

<section class="newsletter">
  <h1>Subscribe to the Newsletter</h1>
  <form> <!-- ... --> </form>
</section>

What does parse mean? <br/>
To parse, in computer science, is where a string of commands – usually a program – is separated into more easily processed components, 
which are analyzed for correct syntax and then attached to tags that define each component. The computer can then process each program chunk and transform it into machine language.

Now that we’ve learned about some of the most common HTML elements, it’s time to learn how to set up an HTML file.

HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>

This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.

In the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include <!DOCTYPE html> at the very beginning of your HTML documents.

Lastly, HTML code is always saved in a file with an .html extension.

<!-- 1/14 Questions -->
<!-- How does the browser know what language other documents are written in? For example, why doesn’t css need a doctype?
Ans: DOCTYPE declarations are only required for html based documents. Other JavaScript or CSS files are actually loaded into the page with <link> or tags. 
These tags signify the file type to the browser thereby allowing the browser to properly parse the file. -->

<!-- Why is “DOCTYPE” uppercase but “html” lower? 
<!-- Ans: In a word, convention.
As for case sensitivity, it still applies where XML conforming documents are concerned. Guess what folks, JSX and React are XML conforming.

If neither of those is a concern, then by all means continue with the assumption that case insensitity exists. We still come back to convention. The thing that can only be attributed to unwritten rules. Write HTML in UPPERCASE at one’s own peril.

The thing to keep in mind is that the document type declararation is not HTML or XML. It is SGML, the parent schema of the whole shebang, and IT is case insensitive. After that, the other paradigms shed their own light.

This is related to the question of... can attribute contain HTML tags?
Ans: Yes, but if you deal with XML content, like JSX and React, it may produce invalid result.

Note that not only is it possible to include markup inside attributes, but the HTML5 srcdoc attribute on the iframe element positively encourages it.
Note, that when served with an XML content type (e.g. application/xhtml+xml), it is not valid, or even well-formed.

<!--
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration provides the browser with two pieces of information (the type of document and the HTML version to expect), but it doesn’t actually add any HTML structure or content.

***NOTE anything in line 1 is not a HTML element or tag. It is a document type decalaration that is telling the computer that what you're giving a html5 and it is looking at a html5 document 
and for it to be translated to machine code/parsed accordingly. 

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:

Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code. Without these tags, it’s possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.
-->


<!-- 2/14 Questions -->
<!-- Without the html tags mentioned in this lesson, in what ways might the browser misinterpret our HTML code?
Ans: The <html> tag is actually an example of an optional tag which means that there are situations in which it can be omitted. 
Even though omitted optional tags will be inserted into the document by the browser and may not always be required, most developers would say that it is best practice to include these tags. 
Including optional tags enhances readability, improves cross-browser support, and takes some burden off of the browser.

In short, while the <html> tag can be omitted I do not believe it should be omitted. -->


<!-- Why do we need the HTML tag after the declaration?
Ans: The DTD (Document type declaration) is not HTML, but SGML. It tells the user agent that the root element of the document is <html></html>. 
The de facto namespace is HTML5. Other than that the declaration has no part in DOM (Document Object Model).-->

<!-- Why is the doctype a different color from the <html> tags? 
Ans: for readability but NOTE Line 1 is not actually an HTML element or tag. As you discovered in the first exercise of this lesson, it is a declaration that lets the browser know that it is looking at an HTML5 document and it should be parsed accordingly.

Text editors like the one you are using in this workspace often use different colors to help developers distinguish between different pieces of code and to aid in overall readability. -->

<!--
Remember the <body> tag? The <head> element is part of this HTML metaphor. It goes above our <body> element.

The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. 
Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page. Unlike the information inside of the <body> tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself. 
You’ll see an example of this in the next exercise. -->


<!-- 7/14 Questions -->
<!-- This exercise uses the `_blank` value to open pages in new tabs. Does the `target` attribute have other values?
Ans: Yes, there are 4 different values the target attribute can have: _self, _blank, _parent, or _top -->
<!-- Do attributes need to be in a specific order?
Ans:No -->

Thus far you have learned how to link to external web pages. Many sites also link to internal web pages like Home, About, and Contact.

Before we learn how to link between internal pages, let’s establish where our files are stored. When making multi-page static websites, web developers often store HTML files in the root directory,
or a main folder where all the files for the project are stored. As the size of the projects you create grows, you may use additional folders within the main project folder to organize your code.

project-folder/
|—— about.html
|—— contact.html
|—— index.html

The example above shows three different files — about.html, contact.html, and index.html in one folder.

HTML files are often stored in the same folder, as shown in the example above. If the browser is currently displaying index.html, it also knows that about.html and contact.html are in the same folder. 
Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a relative path.

<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a> 

In this example, the <a> tag is used with a relative path to link from the current HTML file to the contact.html file in the same folder. On the web page, Contact will appear as a link.

A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website, such as ./index.html) versus an absolute path (a full URL, 
like https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html which is stored in a different folder). 
-->


<!-- 8/14 Questions -->
<!-- Do absolute paths always point to remote files or assets?
Ans: No. Absolute paths may also be used to point to local files or assets. However, when linking to local files it generally makes more sense to store files or assets within the project directory 
itself and then use a relative path to point to it. To learn more about paths, check out this StackExchange thread.  https://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/ -->
<!-- What are the advantages of using relative paths? 
Ans: 

examples of absolute path:

# windows
c:\users\username\pictures\img1.jpg
# *nix
/home/username/pictures/img1.jpg

if I then move the image from pictures to documents, the absolute path would also break.

relative paths are better, given we can then move the entire project to a different computer (which very likely has a different username) and we don’t have to go and find all the absolute paths with the username in it

<!-- The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder. -->
<!--  ../ in front of the filename tells the browser to look in the folder above the current folder.-->


<!--

./ = look in current folder 
../ = look in the folder above the current 

no / = when you referencing an item that is in same folder as the page where the link appears. eg. <a href="linkhere.html">Click Me</a>

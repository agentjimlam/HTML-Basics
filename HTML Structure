What does parse mean? <br/>
To parse, in computer science, is where a string of commands – usually a program – is separated into more easily processed components, 
which are analyzed for correct syntax and then attached to tags that define each component. The computer can then process each program chunk and transform it into machine language.

Now that we’ve learned about some of the most common HTML elements, it’s time to learn how to set up an HTML file.

HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>

This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.

In the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include <!DOCTYPE html> at the very beginning of your HTML documents.

Lastly, HTML code is always saved in a file with an .html extension.

<!-- How does the browser know what language other documents are written in? For example, why doesn’t css need a doctype?


DOCTYPE declarations are only required for html based documents. Other JavaScript or CSS files are actually loaded into the page with <link> or tags. 
These tags signify the file type to the browser thereby allowing the browser to properly parse the file.

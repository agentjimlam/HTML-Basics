<!-- Page 3/16 Questions -->
<!-- what is a web browser? browser is a piece of software which allows us to display content on the web-->
<!-- when you type something outside <body> element and the line is printed, it's because the compiler auto-assume you meant to put it in the <body>, so it autocorrects. 


<!-- Page 4/16 Questions -->
<!-- <html> is the parent element of the <body> element = <body> element is nested within the <html>. Same thing -->
<!-- Is it correct to say that the <body> element is nested within the <html> element? 
Answer: That is correct! The <html> tag is the root element of every page and it should always have <head> and <body> child elements. The <head> and <body> elements are siblings to each other and children to the <html> parent.-->
<!--  What is the point of nesting the <p> element in a <div> element? 
Answer: In this case, this is done purely for demonstrative purpose. In the future you will find that <div> elements are often used to group related content. This can serve to give a page some added structure and to allow for more modular styling. -->

<!-- Page 5/16 Questions -->
<!-- I thought that CSS controlled the presentation of a page but it looks like heading elements have different sizes. Isn’t font size more presentation than structure?
Answer: Good observation! You are correct in that font size is a presentational aspect of a page and CSS defines how our pages look. The font size of the text contained within a heading element is controlled by the browser’s default style sheet. 
Developers can overwrite this default style sheet by creating their own custom style sheets. To learn more about style sheets, check out the Learn CSS course.
AKA... The font size of Heading elements in html affects font size when you translate it through a CSS style sheet/template. Like installing graphic game mod -->

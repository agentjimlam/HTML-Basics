<!-- Page 3/16 Questions -->
<!-- what is a web browser? browser is a piece of software which allows us to display content on the web-->
<!-- when you type something outside <body> element and the line is printed, it's because the compiler auto-assume you meant to put it in the <body>, so it autocorrects. 


<!-- Page 4/16 Questions -->
<!-- <html> is the parent element of the <body> element = <body> element is nested within the <html>. Same thing -->
<!-- Is it correct to say that the <body> element is nested within the <html> element? 
Answer: That is correct! The <html> tag is the root element of every page and it should always have <head> and <body> child elements. The <head> and <body> elements are siblings to each other and children to the <html> parent.-->
<!--  What is the point of nesting the <p> element in a <div> element? 
Answer: In this case, this is done purely for demonstrative purpose. In the future you will find that <div> elements are often used to group related content. This can serve to give a page some added structure and to allow for more modular styling. -->

<!-- Page 5/16 Questions -->
<!-- I thought that CSS controlled the presentation of a page but it looks like heading elements have different sizes. Isn’t font size more presentation than structure?
Answer: Good observation! You are correct in that font size is a presentational aspect of a page and CSS defines how our pages look. The font size of the text contained within a heading element is controlled by the browser’s default style sheet. 
Developers can overwrite this default style sheet by creating their own custom style sheets. To learn more about style sheets, check out the Learn CSS course.
AKA... The font size of Heading elements in html affects font size when you translate it through a CSS style sheet/template. Like installing graphic game mod -->

<!-- Do <div> elements increase the complexity of our HTML structure? 
Answer: Maybe but the whole point is for organising so you ahve better readability and targetability/finding of info. -->
<!-- Why should we use divs if they don’t change things visually? I don’t see any visual or sectional changes to the text when I add the <div> tags. Is there supposed to be some change in appearance?
Answer: div (short for division) allows us to divide our page into different sections, to position this sections. Divs are very useful. The change might not be the most visual one, doesn’t make it less useful. 
if we only used text, everything would just be from top to bottom. Look at this forum, imaging where divs might be (to divide different replies for example), 
or to place the scroll bar on the right hand side of the page and staying there even though we are scrolling through the replies. -->

<!-- What kind of information do attributes provide? 
Answer: There are several different types of attributes which can extend tags in different ways. Usually attributes either change an element’s behavior, provide metadata about the element, or provide labeling information about the element.
For example, the id attribute uniquely identifies an element whereas the class attribute identifies a whole group of elements. This labeling information can then be used to target content for styling, scripting, or (for the id attribute) linking. -->
